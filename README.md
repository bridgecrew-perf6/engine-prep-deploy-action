# engine-prep-deploy-action

Hi! This action is used internally at Mutate to detect & compute variables needed at build time for our engine.

GitHub doesn't have good support for private actions for non-enterprise users, and committing ~470 JavaScript files from `node_modules` into our engine repo wasn't an option. Sorry that this "open source" repo doesn't really contribute to anyone!

Mutate has various open-source repositories available that _are_ helpful, however, with many more to come as we continue an ongoing open-source initiative! Follow us at https://github.com/mutate-ab for news!
